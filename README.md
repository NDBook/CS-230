Operating Platforms

  For this project the client is The Gaming Room and the application to be developed is Draw It or Lose It.  The Draw It or Lose It game is only available on Android and The Gaming Room would like it to be accessible on any device that has access to the web.  The plan is to begin development for a web-based application on Windows an integrate it with the current Android version.    The area I did particularly well in during the was identifying the features necessary to meet the clients needs and how they can be implemneted.  I recommended they implement a cloud-based server for web-based game.  My solution to their system architecture should alleviate any access concerns previously stated by the client.  When developing the code, having a class diagram accessible made identifying how they will interact with each much more comprehendable.  Using the diagram as a map for development. If I could improve on any aspect of this project, I would add more detail.  I know how important including as many details as possible can be when beginning a project.  It is important to understanding the user's needs when developing because you want the user to use the application more than once.  If the interface is smooth and easy to understand, the user will most likely use it again and recommend it to others.
